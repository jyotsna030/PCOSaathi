# PCOSaathi : Women's Health Clustering & Personalized Recommendations

## 📌 Overview
**PCOSaathi** is an AI-powered health companion designed to support women in managing PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) by providing personalized health recommendations. Submitted under the **Infosys Springboard iAccelerate Women’s Hackathon 2025**.

The application leverages **machine learning** to analyze women's health data and provide **personalized health recommendations**.It clusters users based on key health parameters like **weight gain, hair loss, acne, period regularity, and exercise, etc** to generate insights for managing conditions like **PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)**.

The application is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend, with **Agglomerative Clustering** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** for clustering. The recommendations are tailored to cluster women based on their health needs and prefrences in context of Indian dietary habits and lifestyle preferences.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data-driven clustering**: Uses machine learning models to group users based on health parameters, needs and prefrences.
- **Personalized recommendations**: Offers customized lifestyle, diet, and exercise advice.
- **Indian context**: Tailored suggestions based on local food, routines, and wellness practices.
- **User-friendly UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Agglomerative Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering)
  - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
- **Data Processing**: StandardScaler for normalization

## ⚡ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Women-Health-Clustering.git
   cd Women-Health-Clustering
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (Recommended)
```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the application**
```bash
   streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **User inputs their health data**: Age, weight gain, hair loss, acne severity, period regularity, and exercise routine.
2. **Machine learning models analyze the data**: Clusters users based on similarities.
3. **Personalized health recommendations**: The app provides practical, culturally relevant health advice.
